# Fantasy sentence generator

My idea was to generate sentences based on a fantasy setting for codecademy's mixed messages project.

Created a function that generates a random index for each array and used the indices for each of them to put together a sentence.

## Example output:
*Chimera Invokes Orb of Foresight*
